        <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
        <p>First we need to learn some basic HTML</p>
        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Headings define the outline of your webpage. There are six lever of headings.</p>
        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add an "ul" element (it stands for unordered list).</li>
            <li>Add each item in its own "li" element (it stands for list element).</li>
            <li>The order of list elements does not matter.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is how you make an ordered list:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping the content (it stans for ordered list).</li>
            <li>But, the list item elements "li" are the same.</li>
            <li>Notice, also hot the number inside the list increment on their own.</li>
            <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list. xD</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
        <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or a phrase</p>
        <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>
        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
